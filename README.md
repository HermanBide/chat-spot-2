#### MVP Libraries & Dependencies

> Use this section to list the key supporting libraries and their role in the project.

|   Library    | Description                                |
| :----------: | :----------------------------------------- |
|    React     | _React framwork for my client._ |
| React Router | _Router to different components._ |
| axios | _using axios to make Api call, and call to endpoints._ |
| icons | _import Material -icons for visual display ._ |


<br>

#### MVP Components

> Use this section to define your React components and the data architecture of your app.

```
src
|__ App/
      |__ data-tests
      |__ fonts
      |__ images
      |__ wireframes

      |__ Form.jsx
      |__ CommentBox.jsx
      |__ Advice.jsx
      |__ Footer.jsx
```

<br>

#### MVP Breakdown

> Use this section to go into further depth regarding every component, including breaking down the components as stateless or stateful, and considering the passing of data between those components.

|  Component   |    Type    | state | props | hooks | Description                                |
| :----------: | :--------: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :----------------------------------------- |
|    App.js    |   class    |   y   |   n   |   n   | _make Api call and display content. route to other component pages_ |
|  Navigation  | functional |   n   |   n   |   n   | _nav through menu._ |
|     Form     | functional |   y   |   n   |   y   | _client will write text inside input form ._ |
|  CommentBox  | functional |   y   |   n   |   y   | _Client will write comment inside comment box._ |

|    Footer    | functional |   n   |   n   |   n   | _social media, email, etc._ |

<br>

#### MVP Timeframes

> Use this section to estimate the time necessary to build out each of the components you've described above. 
>
> Time frames are key to the development cycle. You have limited time to code your app, and your estimates can then be used to evalute possibilities of your MVP and post-MVP based on time needed. It's best you assume an additional hour for each component, as well as a few hours added to the total time, to play it safe.

| Task             | Priority | Estimated Time | Time Invested | Actual Time |
| ---------------- | :------: | :------------: | :-----------: | :---------: |
| Api call         |    H     |     2 hrs      |      hrs     |     hrs    |
| build components |    H     |     3 hrs      |      hrs     |     TBD     |
| Add blog form    |    H     |     2 hrs      |      hrs     |     TBD     |
| axios calls (put, push, get, delete      |    H     |     4 hrs      |      hrs     |     TBD     |
| Add css          |    L     |     3 hrs      |      hrs     |     TBD     |
| TOTAL            |          |      |     hrs     |     TBD     |
